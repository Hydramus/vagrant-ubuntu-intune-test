# Vagrant-ubuntu-intune-test
## Using Vagrant to spin up new ubuntu 22 LTS with a GUI for you to test with.
Creating a test device to test enrollment for ubuntu into the new intune set up (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/user-help/enroll-device-linux)

I haven't automated or put in any specific company data for sensitivity but the framework is there to create be able to spin up hosts up and down.

I am also using Virtual box here as the provider.
Note that the shared directory as well is using GNU/Unix syntax, feel free to change this for your own pathing or windows pathing.
